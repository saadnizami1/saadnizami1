**High School Student | App Developer | Drone Business Owner | Computational Physicist**

I’m a student developer from Pakistan focused on building apps and tools that solve real problems. Whether it’s a platform for social good, an AI-supported health app, or an educational simulator for nuclear physics — I bring ideas to life with clean code and practical design.

## 🚧 Projects In Progress

### 🔹 GoFundPK  
> *A crowdfunding app built for Pakistan.*  
Connects people in need with donors through a clean, mobile-first platform inspired by GoFundMe — but adapted to local culture and needs.

### 🔹 HealthSafe  
> *Your allergy-aware food safety scanner.*  
Take a photo of your food, and the app tells you whether it’s safe for you based on your allergy profile.

### 🔹 ArtRank  
> *Your art, judged by the world.*  
Upload images or paintings and get community feedback through an upvote/downvote system. Build reputation through creativity.

### 🔹 Nuclear Physics Simulators  
> *Python-based educational tools that simulate real-world nuclear reactions.*  
Chain reactions, typeshift behavior, and visual demos built for students, teachers, and enthusiasts.
